🌍 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Prediction using Machine Learning
This project focuses on understanding and predicting CO₂ emissions based on economic and energy usage metrics across multiple countries. Leveraging pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, we process real-world data and apply regression techniques to model emissions trends.

📌 Project Objectives
🔎 Explore and understand the relationship between CO₂ emissions and factors like GDP, population, and energy usage.

🛠 Preprocess data including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

📊 Visualize patterns and correlations to gain insights.

🤖 Train and test multiple regression models.

📈 Predict emissions using the best-fit model.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
🐼 pandas – for data manipulation

📊 matplotlib & seaborn – for visual analytics

⚙ scikit-learn – for regression and evaluation

📁 Dataset Overview
📅 Year-wise data for countries like India, USA, China, Germany, etc.

🧪 Features: GDP, Population, Energy Use, and CO2 Emissions

🧪 ML Models Used
✅ Linear Regression

✅ Lasso Regression

✅ Ridge Regression

Models were evaluated using:

🧮 Mean Squared Error (MSE)

🧮 R² Score

📈 Results
Ridge Regression gave the best prediction accuracy among tested models.

Insightful correlations between GDP and CO₂ emissions were visualized.
